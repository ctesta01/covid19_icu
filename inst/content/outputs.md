**<h3> MODEL OUTPUTS </h3>**

<br/>

**<h4> Plot A </h4>**

* This plot depicts  the **COVID19+ cases presenting to the ED per day** during the days included in the simulation.  For example, on day 10, the plot
	gives the number of COVID19+ cases which presented to the ED on day 10.

<br/> 

**<h4> Plot B </h4>**

* **Cumulative ED visits (black curve)**: the total number of ED visits which occured in the simulation since time 0.  For example,
	on day 10, the black curve gives the total number of ED visits that occurred between day 0 and day 10.

* **Cumulative deaths (red curve)**: the total number of deaths observed in the simulation since time 0.  For example, on day 10, the red curve
	gives the total number of deaths that occurred between day 0 and day 10. 
 
**<h4> Plot C </h4>**

* **Cumulative deaths by location**: the total number of deaths observed from each compartment in the model.

+ **Deaths in the ICU (black)**: the difference between the maximum and minimum value spanned by the black area represents the number of 
	deaths which occurred in the ICU since time 0. 

**<h4> Plot D </h4>**
